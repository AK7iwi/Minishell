STDOUT_FILENO??

1) Lexer: 

Review the main of tokenizer(no need to declare token in but in str_handler and special_char_handler yes)
check tokenisation file(doc)

2) Synthesis_analysis:

check parser_rules file(doc)

3) AST: 

Find the right precedence
Handle error 

4)ENV:

create small env for env -i

5) Exec: 

handle error in ast_exec

a) Prompt: OK

b) Working History ~

c) Builtins OK~~

handle error, check error for builtins
test with no env, nned protect 
handle paramaters (if args[1]) return ;

echo OK
cd OK, but need netter error handling 
pwd OK
export: ~, need to handle when no equal 
env: OK,

I )Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is
connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.

II) AND and OR OK

h)Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values.

Handle $? Which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline

i) Signaux 

Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
• In interactive mode:
◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line. OK
◦ ctrl-D exits the shell. OK
◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.
