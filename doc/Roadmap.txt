General: 

!!!!!!!ERROR handling
Leak when malloc = NULL; free before return 
error in stderr

modif proto of ast_printer = like ast_exec 
int --> int32t / norme
protect ft_strdup
protect readline ~~
Use strcmp instead of strncmp
EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE logique
Handle exit code

STDOUT_FILENO??

I) Lexer: 

Review the main of tokenizer(no need to declare token in but in str_handler and special_char_handler yes)
check tokenisation file(doc)

II) Synthesis_analysis:

check parser_rules file(doc)

III) AST: 

Find the right precedence
Handle error 

IV)ENV:

create small env for env -i

V) Exec: 

handle error in ast_exec
handle when its a builtins but the builtins fail. 

	a) Prompt: OK

	b) Working History ~

	c) Builtins OK~~

		handle error, check error for builtins
		test with no env, nned protect 
		handle paramaters (if args[1]) return ;

		echo OK
		cd OK, but need better error handling 
		pwd OK
		export: ~, need to handle when no equal 
		env: OK, 
		unset OK,
		exit OK

	d) Command OK
		Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
		relative or an absolute path). 

	e) redirections

	f) here-doc

	g) Operator

		1)Implement pipes (| character). OK

		2) AND and OR OK

	h)Handle environment variables 

	Handle $? Which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
	foreground pipeline

	i) Signals 

	Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
	• In interactive mode:
	◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line. OK
	◦ ctrl-D exits the shell. ~~ not working when line is not working 
	◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.

	j) issue with paren when using pipe

VI) Tester
