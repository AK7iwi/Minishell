General: 

!!!!!!!ERROR handling
Leak when malloc = NULL; free before return 
error in stderr

Finish to rename(free and print ) ~~
modif proto of ast_printer = like ast_exec 
int --> int32t / norme
protect ft_strdup
protect readline
utils-->tools
Use strcmp instead of strncmp
EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE logique

1) Lexer: 

Review the main of tokenizer(no need to declare token in but in str_handler and special_char_handler yes)
check tokenisation file(doc)

2) Synthesis_analysis:

check parser_rules file(doc)

3) AST: 

Find the right precedence
Handle error 

4)ENV:

create small env for env -i

5) Exec: 

handle error in ast_exec

a) Prompt: OK

b) Working History

c) Builtins OK~~

handle error, check error for builtins
test with no env
handle paramaters (if args[1]) return ;

echo OK
cd OK, but need netter error handling 
pwd OK
export: ~, need to handle when no equal 
env: OK, 
unset OK,
exit OK

d) Command
Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
relative or an absolute path).

e) Implement redirections 

f) Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is
connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.

g)Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values.

Handle $? Which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline

h)Signaux OK

Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
• In interactive mode:
◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.
