General: 

Leak when malloc = NULL; free before return 
error in stderr
test open,dup2,pipe,fork errors 
int --> int32t / norme
protect ft_strdup
protect readline ~~
Use strcmp instead of strncmp, check this fct when used
Handle exit code ,check exit value
Rename tube when pipe

I) Lexer: 

Review the main of tokenizer(no need to declare token in but in str_handler and special_char_handler yes)
check tokenisation file(doc)

II) Synthesis_analysis:

check parser_rules file(doc)

III) AST: 

Find the right precedence, compare with bash result

IV)ENV:

create small env for env -i

V) Exec: 

handle error in ast_exec ~~ to recheck 

	a) Prompt: OK

	b) Working History ~

	c) Builtins OK~~

		handle error, check error for builtins
		test with no env, need protect ~
		handle paramaters (if args[1]) return ;

		echo OK
		cd OK, but need better error handling 
		pwd OK
		export: ~, need to handle when no equal 
		env: OK, 
		unset OK,
		exit OK

	d) Command OK 

	e) Redirections OK

	f) Operator OK

		1) PIPE OK,

		2) AND and OR OK

	g)Handle environment variables 

	Handle $? Which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
	foreground pipeline

	h) Signals 

	Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
	• In interactive mode:
	◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line. OK
	◦ ctrl-D exits the shell. OK
	◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.

	i) issue with paren
		loop in ast_creator, in subsh_node, here: (*new_node)->subshell.root = ast_algo(current, 0);

VI) Tester
