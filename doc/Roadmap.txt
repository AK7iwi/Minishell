General: 

Finish to rename(free and print ) ~~
modif proto of ast_printer = like ast_exec 
Leak when malloc = NULL;
int --> int32t
protect ft_strdup
protect readline
utils-->tools
error in stderr
Use strcmp instead of strncmp
EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE logique

1) Lexer: 

Review the main of tokenizer(no need to declare token in but in str_handler and special_char_handler yes)
check tokenisation file(doc)

2) Synthesis_analysis:

check parser_rules file(doc)

3) AST: 

Find the right precedence
Handle error 

4) Exec: 

handle error in ast_exec

a) Prompt: OK

b) Working History

c) Builtins

handle redir
handle error, check error for builtins
test with no env

echo OK
cd OK, but need netter error handling 
pwd OK
export
env: OK, recheck empty env, create small env for emv -i 
unset
exit

d) Command
Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
relative or an absolute path).

e) Implement redirections 

f) Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is
connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.

g)Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values.

Handle $? Which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline

h)Signaux

Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
• In interactive mode:
◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.

Need to free env
